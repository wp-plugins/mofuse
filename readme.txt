== Installation ==

You can install the MoFuse plugin by unpacking the distributed plugin file in the wp-content/plugins directory of your WordPress installation.

Once unpacked you should see a "MoFuse Plugin" entry in the "Plugins" tab of your administrative interface for WordPress. You'll need to use the "Activate" link under "Plugin Management" to start using this plugin.
